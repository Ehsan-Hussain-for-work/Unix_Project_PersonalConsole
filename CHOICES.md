Choices

November 20th 2025
Ehsan Hussein & Luca Ragosta

For the project concept, we decide to build a portable Linux based handheld console using raspberry pi alongside a game HAT interface.
We chose this idea because me and Ehsan both found it quite interesting and fun to work build a handheld console like the steamdeck or 
the Nintendo switch.

For the hardware, we decided to use the raspberry pi as it is lightweight, supports Linux natively and can run emulation software
such as box86/64 and Wine, software needed to run the games we would like (fallout 1 and 2). As well as the raspberry pi, we also
chose the Game Hat interface due to it having built in buttons, joysticks, speakers as well as a screen. This makes it an all in one 
portable console, and, due to the joysticks, makes it perfect for isometric games relative to other types of hardware we could've used. It 
also has pretty good physical integration with the raspberry pi.

We are currently working on printing a 3d shell as what we currently have is very fragile and exposed. The shell would protect the electrical 
components within the console from external elements. 


For the software we decided to use the Raspberry Pi OS due to the fact it is optimized for the raspberry pi hardware. It also support Box86/64 and 
Wine, software needed to run the games we want. AntiMicroX would be required to convert the keyboard inputs of the game into joystick and button inputs 
as it will be played on a handheld console and not a computer with a keyboard.

For the game choice, we are choosing both fallout 1 & 2 as:
-They are both a part of the same franchise
-They are both isometric games, making them better for the console relative to a fps game
-They are also classic retro games which fit the "vibe" of our console

Things that were considered but rejected:

We considered using RetroPie but rejected it as it focuses on console games and Fallout 1 & 2 are not console games.
