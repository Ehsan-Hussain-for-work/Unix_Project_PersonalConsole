# Unix_Project_PersonalConsole
This is a repository dedicated to setting-up a handheld console from scratch.
You will be instructed on how to install and configure your very own handheld console and add whatever game you'd want on it.

### Our Goal
Once properly set up, you'll have a console that'll automatically access a web-based database of games (of your choosing) that can be played anywhere and anytime. You'll no longer need to rely on expensive pre-made consoles, when you can make your own console with only what you spicifically want in it.
