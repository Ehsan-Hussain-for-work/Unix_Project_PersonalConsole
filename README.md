# Unix_Project_PersonalConsole
This repository is dedicated to setting up a handheld console from scratch.
You will be guided through the process of installing and configuring your own
handheld console and adding any games you want.

## Our Goal
Once properly set up, you will have a console that automatically accesses a
web-based game database of your choosing, allowing games to be played anywhere
and anytime. You will no longer need to rely on expensive pre-made consoles when
you can build a custom device containing only what you want.
